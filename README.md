> A curated list of notes, AI prompts, and resources to supercharge your scientific writing, heavily inspired by the classic textbook "Science Research Writing" by Hilary Glasman-Deal.

This repository provides chapter-by-chapter summaries of the book and ready-to-use AI prompts to help you revise your scientific papers efficiently and effectively.

## Core Philosophy

This project combines the structured, human-centric wisdom of Glasman-Deal's book with the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude. Our goal is to create an efficient, reliable, and high-quality workflow for academic writing.

## How to Use

1.  **Learn the Core Concepts:** Navigate to the `notes_and_prompts` directory and select the file corresponding to the paper section you are writing (e.g., `01-Introduction.md`). Read the notes to understand the key writing objectives and structural models from the book.

2.  **Copy the AI Prompt:** In the lower half of each file, you will find a carefully crafted AI prompt. Copy the entire prompt text.

3.  **Interact with Your AI:** Open your preferred AI tool, paste the copied prompt, and then paste your own draft into the designated `[PASTE YOUR DRAFT HERE]` section.

4.  **Iterate and Refine:** The AI will revise your text based on the rules derived from the book. Carefully review the AI's suggestions and refine them to fit your specific research. Remember, the AI is an assistant; you are the author.
